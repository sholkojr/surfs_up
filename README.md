The below report details a preliminary analysis of temperature and rainfall data accross Hawaii to support development of a business case to promote investment in a beachside ice cream stand.

## Objective
To summarize weather station data to review temperature data to understand the amount of time through a calendar year that would be adverse to the business of a beachside ice creas stand: Poor weather reducing customer traffic.  Focus was placed on December and June months to compare and contrast time of year.

## Results
The below tables summarize the temperature data for June and December

### June Temperature Data

### December Temperature Data

The following key takeaways from the above statistics:
- Average temperature drops by 4 degrees between June and December.  
- The December data shows that 75% of days are above 69 degrees F, which could be considered not to be detrimental to customer preferences for ice cream.
- There 25% of days in the winter that could be anticipated that customer traffic would be affected because of low outdoor temperatures.

## Summary
In summary overall temperatures in the summer months are conductive to customer preference for ice cream with vast majority of temperatures above 70.  Winter temperature are cooler with expected reduction in overall foot traffic would be ~25% less as temperatures would be below 69 degrees F which is not conductive to customer preferences.

Further analysis would pull precipitation data to couple with temperature data based on criteria for poor customer foot traffice, including significant rainfall and low temperatures.
